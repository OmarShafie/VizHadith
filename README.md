# The Hadith Visual Search Engine

Welcome to **[Hadith Visual Search Engine](https://omarshafie.github.io/hadith/)**, a search engine which provides Visual analysis of *Hadith Isnad tree* (Narration routes) highlighting narrators and narrator grades. The engine also provides the ability to search for Isnad patterns.

**The Hadith** is Narration of sayings and actions of the prophet. In its classic form, a hadith has two parts â€” the sequence of reporting individuals who have transmitted the report (*the isnad*), and the actual sayings of the prophet/companion (*the matn*). Hadith books are collections of hadiths written in the classic forms.
